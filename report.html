                <p>
                    This is my experience as a 100% newbie: As far as I understand, this course is for beginners, but after completing the first few weeks.
                    I do not mean that it is much harder than I expected. </p>
                    <p>I intend on making this website a responsive portfolio website to test my skills whereas have participated on this assignment before since I am second year. 
                        To complete the optional assignment of the HTML section, I had to pause, search, and complete the Coursera Introduction to HTML Guided Project which helped 
                        me to understand things clearly and use course notes to navigate the HTML process; 
                        I took what I learned from the lectures and completed my online personal 
                        training in web development with great insight, knowledge, confidence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>If learning should be a good place between activation or exposure to knowledge and achieving a clear goal with the right challenge,
                             I don't think the purpose of learning has been achieved 100%, at least for me.
                              I have to admit that I was scared at first as sometimes I found it difficult to follow the talk and the lack of face to face
                               simply means that my communication with the speech is not 100% I feel like
                                the difficulty of new interventions The student also says that I have no friends
                                 to share questions The lesson emphasizes the importance of practice, but it seems
                                  that we ignore the fact that we do it very well or use it after being given the tools 
                                  we understand. I believe a lot of things are available to work with but are very helpful
                                   if they understand what you are doing with them. 
                                   </p>
                                   <p>I have to say that this course has been my biggest challenge so far and I am glad that the research has been difficult and in some cases very little has been explained or I find that the language used is mostly targeted at newbies as I am always looking for explanations Things and why they are used. All in all it has been great so far with a lot of coverage.
